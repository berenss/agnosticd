== Overview

`binder-sp-athc` is a Ansible 2.9/Dark Tower binder before `binder-aap2-default` goes live.
It is designed for the Automate The Hybrid Cloud Sales Play but is very generic.
Any CI's using this should be very simple to move to `binder-aap2-default`.
The goal is a simple change of `env_type: ` in an AgnosticV CI directory.
